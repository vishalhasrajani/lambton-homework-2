Use the signals above, consider a actual vivid simulation mode, and add
random noise in output signal. In this simulation, we divide time domain
into several duration, and call each duration as frame. The scanning
cycle of an oscilloscope is equal to frame period, that means each time
we simulate a frame of signal, and the display will be refreshed once.
Therefore, we can get a constantly sliding input signal, a carrier signal
with phase jitter, and output signal with noise.
