1. Test your UART on BBB by loopback TXD and RXD as our slides.
2. Set up and achieve UART interfacing communication between BBB and
Arduino. You can write a program to control the on-board LED of Arduino input and response the feedback as output.
3. Your BBB should control your Arduino on-board LED, and change its
flashing frequency
