AM modulation using matlab:

question :

Simulate an amplitude modulation (AM) system with all input, carrier
and output signals. Say the input signal is a cosine wave with amplitude
as 2V and frequency as 1000Hz. The carrier signal is also a cosine wave
with amplitude as 5V and frequency as 10KHz. The modulation degree
is 0.5, and the initial phases of all cosine wave are 0. (Recall Nyquist
sampling theorem to avoid distortion i.e. under sampling)
