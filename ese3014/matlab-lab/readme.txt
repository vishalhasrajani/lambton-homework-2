1. Create a 2D plot of the sine function between 0 and 2π.
2. Create a 3D plot of a surface by creating a grid along the X and Y axes
and plotting the Z-coordinate according to the exponential function.
3. Write a script to apply if and if-else statements.
4. Write a script to apply conditional logic switch.
5. Write a script to perform loop with a while condition.
6. Write a script to plot a vector of random data. Draw a horizontal line at
the mean. Save the script and run it from the command line.
7. Write a script that calculates the mean of five samples of data from a
vector of random data. Calculate the overall mean. Use a for loop to
perform the calculations. For each iteration of the loop print out the
intermediate results. Use an if..else control block to display the results
depending on whether the mean of the samples is less than, greater than
or equal to the overall mean.
8. Create a function that calculates the area of a circle with the radius as input in command window. Call this function from the MATLAB command
line or in a MATLAB script (.m).
9. Create a function that calculates the sum of an arbitrary number of sinusoidal terms. Call this function from the MATLAB command line or in a
MATLAB script (.m).
