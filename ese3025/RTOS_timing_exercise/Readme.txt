Reproduce the three-task example from the notes, up to the LCM time of 70 time units, first using fixed-priority scheduling, and then again but using EDF dynamic-priority scheduling.

Where do the missed deadlines appear when you apply a fixed-priority RM scheduling policy?

When does the idle task occur, in both fixed- and dynamic-priority scenarios?

What happens if you attempt to accommodate a fourth task, S_4, with a period of T_4=10, and C_4=2, using either fixed-priority or dynamic priority schemes? Provide timing diagrams.
